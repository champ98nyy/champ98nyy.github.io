      <div class="page-description">
        <p class="coding-description">For as long as I can remember, I've been intrigued by the notion of learning to code. I'd consider taking a course, but life would be busy and I'd accept that "I don't have time right now."</p>
        <p class="coding-description">Towards the tail end of 2020, I made the decision to just go for it. Start somewhere and see where it takes me. After researching the endless list of options available online, I registered for my first course:</p>

              <p class="card-text">In this Responsive Web Design Certificate program, I learned the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML for content, and CSS for design.</p>
              <p class="card-text">After mastering the basics, I moved on to more modern techniques like CSS variables, along with best practices for accessibility. Finally, I learned how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes with CSS Grid.</p>

          <p class="coding-description">After earning freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certificate, I jumped right into their next certificate program: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. This was my first experience with a more complex language, requiring algorithmic computational thinking. While I was loving what I was learning, I ultimately decided to take a step back and ground my educational journey in a more traditional introduction to computer science course.</p>
          <p class="coding-description">With so many options available, I initially suspected that it would be a challenge to choose one. However, the overwhelming majority of opinions I heard and read pointed me in the direction of the undisputed world champion of CS courses: </p>

                <p class="card-text">This course taught me how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. The topics covered include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The programming languages covered include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Throughout the curriculum, I completed problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.</p>

          <p class="coding-description">CS50x has not only truly helped me to jumpstart my educational path, it has also confirmed for me that I'm running in the right direction. It's been a struggle at times, but I know that's completely normal and expected for anyone starting out in this space.</p>
          <p class="coding-description">It's those moments when frustration is at a 10, but then I figure out the solution, that I feel on top of the world. Even while I was in the midst of taking the course, I wanted more and more. So, I decided to take on another challenge simultaneously and dive into an even deeper end of the dev pool...</p>

                <p class="card-text">This course provided me with a foundational understanding of machine learning models (e.g. logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, natural language processing, etc.) as well as how these models can solve complex problems in a variety of industries, from medical diagnostics to image recognition to text prediction.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The practice exercises gave me hands-on experience implementing these data science models on data sets, and taught me how to implement machine learning algorithms with PyTorch.</p>

          <p class="coding-description">Completing this course confirmed my fascination of the machine learning space. I plan to continue digging deeper into this space, as I consider it to be one I can envision spending my career with.</p>
          <p class="coding-description">In the short-term, I am focused on completing the last 2 weeks of CS50x and the final project, along with completing freeCodeCamp's JS Algorithms and Data Structures certificate. I recently revisited that course, now with the knowledge and experience of CS50x in my favor. It's been a major confidence booster to see how much more intuitive the course materials now feel.</p>
          <p class="coding-description">I'm truly relishing my time soaking up all this knowledge and I'm beyond excited for what's to come in my future!</p>
